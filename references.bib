abstract = {Artificial intelligence tasks which can be formulated as constraint satisfaction problems, with which this paper is for the most part concerned, are usually by solved backtracking the examining the thrashing behavior that nearly always accompanies backtracking, identifying three of its causes and proposing remedies for them we are led to a class of algorithms whoch can profitably be used to eliminate local (node, arc and path) inconsistencies before any attempt is made to construct a complete solution. A more general paradigm for attacking these tasks is the altenation of constraint manipulation and case analysis producing an OR problem graph which may be searched in any of the usual ways. Many authors, particularly Montanari and Waltz, have contributed to the development of these ideas; a secondary aim of this paper is to trace that history. The primary aim is to provide an accessible, unified framework, within which to present the algorithms including a new path consistency algorithm, to discuss their relationships and the may applications, both realized and potential of network consistency algorithms.}
